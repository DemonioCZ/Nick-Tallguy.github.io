Translators instructions
========================

**This guide is still at the draft stage.**  

- TOC
{:toc}

This guide will have an updated version of the guides currently located at <https://github.com/Nick-Tallguy/Nick-Tallguy.github.io/wiki/Translator-instructions-for-Transifex>.  

When the instructions are updated & on this site in an agreed position then;  

1.  Update the link on the Transifex site to the translator instructions, and  
2.  Delete the guide on the staging site wiki, but add a link there to these instructions in case someone has bookmarked it.  


# Translator instructions - Transifex

You are viewing these instructions on a 'staging site', but the information is transferred frequently between this site and the main LearnOSM site. The [current staging site can be viewed here](http://nick-tallguy.github.io/en/). By using this staging site as an interim, we can check that we haven't lost any formatting marks in the translation process. Don't worry about losing the formatting - we'll put it back in afterwards, as long as we can work out where it goes.

LearnOSM has been using Transifex for a while, but we're still learning! Feedback is appreciated. At present we're not sure how many formatting marks will actually appear in the file that you view, or in the file which we download at the end of the process, so this guide is written on a very provisional basis.

There are limitations on how many languages we can actually display on LearnOSM. Please check if there is a generic version of your language before requesting another language. Although Transifex can cope with the variations on Spanish & English, LearnOSM cannot - please can you see if the main language 'will do'. Get in touch if there is a real problem and we'll try to sort something out.

## Priorities  

We are carrying out a review of any guide before uploading it to Transifex, and you will see the date of that review at the head of the file. Some of these guides may already have been translated, but we can only offer the guide for translation from the latest version, which will be the one with the review date. It may be that only the context has altered where some guides have moved to different sections of LearnOSM. As there is no way for us to indicate that a particular module does not need translating in a particular language, you may wish to compare the modules against what is already on [LearnOSM](http://nick-tallguy.github.io/en/), in case it has already been translated. In a perfect world we would like each module translated, and another person to verify the translation - this is possible with the Transifex system, but only if enough people provide translations!



### essential-setup.txt
This is the file that contains all of the strings we need to use to make a language appear on the site, and to label all of the buttons. It's the first file we will need translating. Many of the strings appear on the Home page of the language you are translating, other strings will be used by the maintenance volunteers when they are adding downloadable versions of the guides, and also to add links to available sections.  

### The priorities column  
When you view the list of 'resources' for translation you should see a timer icon at the far right of the list. We can alter the priority of a guide using this timer. At present the only 'resource' which has a priority set is the **essential-setup.txt** resource which we need for ongoing maintenance. If / when there is an ongoing **Activation** because of a disaster, other guides may be labelled as more urgent.  

### beginners section  
For anyone new to Hot, the beginners section will give them some understanding of the system, and how to carryout basic editing.

### JOSM
Considered by many to be the editor needed if a 'mapper' is to progress beyond the beginner stage.  

### Coordination  
This section is being completely reviewed during 2015, & sections will only appear for translation when we are satisfied they are anticipated to be 'stable'. 

### Other Chapters
If you have an interest in a particular subject, or role within an organisation, you may wish to translate something from elsewhere on the site. If we've reviewed it, and the images associated with the site, it will be available for translation. If there is something you wish to see translated, but it is not available at present, please let us know and we will prioritize it.  email to learnosm@hotosm.org is the easiest route.
## What to translate
### From this header,  
`---`  
`layout: doc`  
`title: iD Editor`  
`permalink: /en/beginner/id-editor/`  
`lang: en`  
`category: beginner`  
`---`  
only the title **iD Editor** requires translation.

### From the main body  
Please only change the words in the text - the formatting marks should be left in place  
`The iD Editor`  
`=============`  

`> This guide may be downloaded as [beginner_id-editor_en.odt](/files/beginner_id-editor_en.odt) or [beginner_id-editor_en.pdf](/files/beginner_id-editor_en.pdf)  `  

In the extract above, you should ignore   
`[beginner_id-editor_en.odt](/files/beginner_id-editor_en.odt)`  
and  
`[beginner_id-editor_en.pdf](/files/beginner_id-editor_en.pdf)`  

This link should also be ignored  
`![image1][]`  
as should the file link which relates to it, which will probably be at the foot of the page.  
`[image1]: /images/beginner/id-editor_image1.png`    

The spaces at the beginning of lines of text are formatting instructions that the text and images should be indented. There are often two spaces at the end of a line of text, which is also a formatting instruction, as is  `>`  if it is at the beginning of a line.
