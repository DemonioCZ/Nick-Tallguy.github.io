- TOC
{:toc}

This guide will have an updated version of the guides currently located at <https://github.com/Nick-Tallguy/Nick-Tallguy.github.io/wiki/Translator-instructions-for-Transifex>.  

When the instructions are updated & on this site in an agreed position then;  

1.  Update the link on the Transifex site to the translator instructions, and  
2.  Delete the guide on the staging site wiki, but add a link there to these instructions in case someone has bookmarked it.
